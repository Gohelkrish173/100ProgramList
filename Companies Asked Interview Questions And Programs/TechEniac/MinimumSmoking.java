// we give a three parameters,
// N - Passenger count.
// X - Smoking of Bus.
// Y - Smoking of Car.

// now, Car takes 4 passengers & bus takes 100 Passengers
// now arrange the passoengers some way that smokking is minimum.

// Input : N = 9 , X = 40 , Y = 8 , Out = 24
// Explaination : for nine passenger we take 3 Car therefore smokking = 24 and if we can pick one bus then it's smoking is 40
// therefore Car smoking < Bus Smoking therefore ans = 24.
